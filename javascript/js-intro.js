/*
 * JS is a single-threaded, weakly-typed interpreted object oriented language.
 * JS was created to provide programmatic control in the web browser.
 * 
 * It was developed alongside browsers and holds a lot of unusual features
 * that were made necessary during the early years of the web.  Some of those
 * include survivability features that most languages would not allow.
 * 
 * Modern JavaScript has changed a lot.  There are alternative runtimes that
 * are not browser based, such as NodeJS, JavaScript is often used for server
 * side code alongside client side code, and has seen significant growth in
 * usage in the last 5 years.
 * 
 * Since we are interested in creating dynamic user experiences on the clientside,
 * learning JavaScript will be an important part of this process.
 * 
 * 
 * Weakly-typed - We don't declare types.
 * Interpreted - Not compiled, parsed by interpreter.
 * Single threaded - No multithreading.
 * 
 * JS is Object oriented, but does not implement many things we consider to
 * be traditional OOP features.
