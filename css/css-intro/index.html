    <h1>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
    <p>Cascading style sheets are a technology used to add styling details to 
        a website. Prior to CSS styling had to be done directly on tags and it was
        gross. There are three locations in which styling can be defined.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inline</li>
            <li>Style tag</li>
            <li>External style sheet</li>
        </ol>

        <section>
            <h2 style="color: red">Inline</h2>
            <p>Inline styles were the original method of providing styling
                metadata to elements. They are applied directly on the tag.
                Inline styles have several disadvantages. First, they clutter
                and mix HTML declaration with styling. This can make it difficult
                to easily parse both HTML and styling data. Additionally, as styles
                have to be applied on every tag, they're not reusable and often 
                resulted in inconsistent design. However, inline styles have the
                highest priority. Inline styles are not recommended.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="style-tag">Style Tag</h2>
            <p>Style tags are the first kind of real CSS. The style tag allows us
                to define styling rules in a tag within the document head. Unlike
                the inline styles, styles defined in the style tag require a selector
                to define what tags they affect. This makes them more flexible and
                reusable. However, as it's still within a tag, it's limited to a single
                HTML page, which restricts its reusability in modern webdesign which
                more often focuses on larger websites or web applications. The style tag
                has the second highest priority after inline.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="external">External Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>External style sheets use a dedicated .css document which is
                linked to the .html document to define styling rules. Because many
                .html documents can reference the same .css sheet, this brings 
                several advantages.  First, it is reusability across many pages
                making it easier for us to maintain our styling rules on a large
                site. Secondly, because its reusable, the document can be cached
                to prevent additional traffic that would otherwise be used to
                load the same rules on each page. Has the lowest priority of other
                options.
